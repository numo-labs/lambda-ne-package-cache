cache ne classic packages for 5mins to return results to clients much faster.

## *Why?*


## *What?*


## *How?*


### Environment variables

> Environment Variables on a Lambda...?

## Open Source the "*Secret Sauce*"...?

As stated above, in order to run this project you will need to have
all the environment variables. To get those you need to contact the TC Nordics API Team.
So while the `code` is 100% open, the `keys` are not.

Think of it this way: If I give you the *location* of the bank vault,
but don't tell you the secret combination, did I just give you all my money?
No, I didn't. You are no closer to swimming in my `cache`.
